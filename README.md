This is a research project happened during the Machine Learning Practical course at the University of Edinburgh in 2018-19.

We studied the robustness of image captioning using attention and/or fine-tuning when images undergo warping, distortion, blurring, etc.

The code here is heavily based on https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning
